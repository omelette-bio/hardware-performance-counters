# CPU FEATURES ANALYSIS

this is a simple C program made for analysing my AMD and INTEL cpus. the data is taken from AMD ??? and Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 3: System Programming Guide chapter 21.

this will maybe have its own repository.

to compile : 
```bash
gcc cpu_features_analysis.c -D (AMD|INTEL) -o HPC_analysis
```

then you just have to :
```bash
./HPC_analysis
```
